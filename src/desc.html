<b>Periodic table memory pegs</b> features flashcards for all 118 elements of the periodic table, to help you memorize and associate name, atomic number, and symbol of elements.

Each element is associated with a picture, which is designed to remind you of the element's name, atomic number, and abbreviation.

The cards in the deck will question you with one of the following: Picture, Name, Symbol, or Number. The other side of the card will display all remaining data, as well as the element's position in the period table. There is also an explanation of how to use the pictures as memory pegs.
